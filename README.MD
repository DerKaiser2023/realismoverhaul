**Realism Overhaul** is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds deeply immersive and physically accurate mechanics to Minecraft, transforming the world into a more realistic, challenging, and dynamic environment.

## 🛠️ Features

### 🌍 World & Block Physics
- **Block Gravity**: All blocks are affected by gravity unless properly supported.
- **Structural Integrity**: Structures collapse if not realistically built (inspired by *7 Days to Die*).
- **Breakable Blocks**: Cracking animations and wear based on tool strength.
- **Debris & Slope Physics**: Broken blocks leave behind debris; items and entities slide on slopes.

### 🧱 Item Physics
- **Realistic Item Drops**: Items bounce and roll instead of spinning.
- **Weight & Resistance**: Heavier items fall faster and slow movement if carried.
- **Thrown Object Physics**: Projectiles behave according to mass, gravity, and wind.

### 💥 Explosion & Destruction Physics
- **Directional Shockwaves**: Explosions push debris realistically based on epicenter.
- **Destructible Terrain**: Craters form from blasts; debris is flung outward.
- **Chain Reactions**: Fire, TNT, and block collapse events can chain together.

### 🌫️ Fluid & Weather Simulation
- **Water Pressure & Flow**: Dynamic currents, realistic flooding, and erosion.
- **Wind Mechanics**: Affects smoke, fire spread, projectiles, and entities.
- **Fire Behavior**: Fire spread is influenced by wind and material flammability.

### 🔺 Terrain & Biome Overhaul
- **Natural Landforms**: Realistic mountains, river valleys, cliffs, and plains.
- **Biome Placement by Climate**: Biomes are generated based on temperature and rainfall maps.
- **Smooth Transitions**: No more hard edges between hot and cold biomes.

this shit is still in development. i may overhaul the code later

note: the python code is just system monitoring code for my sake of monitoring resources
